  1. You need to downgrade your chromedriver. [Download here](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html).
     (recommended version: 2.24, which is the last version that works with the latest emulator)
  2. Add this to your command line arguments: `--chromedriver-executable /path/to/chromedriver`
